            <p class="card-text">Companies have to accept that annual sales time has been shortened by one or even two months due to the Coronavirus epidemic. In this context, will the original product plan meet future demand? When you have a rolling product flow system and lack an in-depth view of every stage of product management, it is easy to make extreme decisions in the adjustment of inventory and stock keeping.

Centric PLMTM adapts to different models and patterns of product development and management, as well as different channels and different organisational structures. The system features a product development calendar management module in the execution stage, which allows businesses to visually manage and track their management plan, its progress level, and preemptive risk controls in each stage in the development process. The PLM system aims to provide timely, accurate, and insightful information to support the resumption and reorganisation of production. It also allows intuitive control of product cost in order to optimise profits, reduce waste, monitor quality, and strengthen performance as the state of the coronavirus pandemic improves.</p>
